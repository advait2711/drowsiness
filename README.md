# drowsiness

• The program uses OpenCV and dlib for facial landmark detection
and eye state analysis.
• The ‘compute’ function calculates the Euclidean distance between
two points.
• The ‘blinked’ function evaluates the blink ratio to determine if the
eyes are closed.
• The program continuously captures framed from the webcam,
detects faces, analyses eyes states, and categorizes the user as
“Sleeping”, “Drowsy”, or “Active” based on blink ratios.
